## News
[Dec 21th, 2025] 🔥 ReasonAff is coming! We have released the original dataset, and as stated in the appendix of the paper, we will filter the test data and provide a cleaner dataset soon, stay tuned!!!
[Aug 11th, 2025] 🔥 Affordance-R1 is coming! We have released the code !!!


Performance of Affordance-R1:

> Affordance-R1 demonstrates extraordinary affordance reasoning ability and powerful generalization ability.

## Model

> Affordance-R1 framework overview. The model processes queries through policy-based reasoning with < think > and < rethink > stages to generate affordance predictions. The policy optimization uses a sophisticated reward system
 comprising (a) format rewards for reasoning structure, (b) perception rewards for spatial accuracy (Box-Num, IOU, L1), and (c) recognition rewards for semantic similarity, enabling effective GRPO-based training for affordance reasoning

Affordance-R1 can  understand complex scenarios and shows good generalization.



## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.git
cd Affordance-R1
conda create -n Affordance-R1 python=3.12
conda activate Affordance-R1
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0
pip install -e .
pip install gensim
```

## Inference
Download pretrained models: [🤗 Affordance-R1](https://huggingface.co/hqking/affordance-r1/tree/main)
Modify the path in inference_scripts/infer.py and then run the following 
```bash
python inference_scripts/infer.py 
```
## Dataset
Download our ReasonAff datasrt [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J2Li8gSDKSfv4hflNvMcXdcO7xhGtVlZ/view?usp=drive_link)
As mentioned in the paper, we found there are some coarse ground truth in the original dataset, and we are trying to filter some dataset in the test split of the data, and we will release it soon! Stay tuned!
## Training
Download pretrained models:[Qwen2.5-VL-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) and [SAM2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2-hiera-large)
Modify the path in `training_scripts/aff_r1.sh` and  `training_scripts/aff_r1.yaml`  and then run the following command to start training:
```bash
bash training_scripts/run_aff_r1.sh
```
After training, run the following command to merge the model"
```bash
python3 training_scripts/model_merger.py --local_dir [path_to_your_actor_checkpoint]
```

## Evaluation  
Data will be released soon! Stay tuned!
```bash
bash evaluation_scripts/eval_aff_r1.sh
```
